# NVC Practice with Claude

An interactive system for learning and practicing Nonviolent Communication (NVC) with Claude as your practice partner.

## What is NVC?

Nonviolent Communication is a framework developed by Marshall Rosenberg, Ph.D. that emphasizes empathy, understanding, and authentic connection. It helps people:

- Express themselves without blame or judgment
- Listen to others with empathy
- Resolve conflicts through understanding needs
- Build deeper, more authentic relationships

The framework centers on four components: **Observations**, **Feelings**, **Needs**, and **Requests** (OFNR).

## How to Use This

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installed
- Or access to Claude through another interface

### Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Claude Code in this directory
3. Start practicing:

```
claude
> Let's practice NVC with scenario 6
```

Or describe your own situation:

```
> I had a difficult conversation with my boss today. Can we roleplay it?
```

### Practice Modes

**Empathic Listening** — Claude plays someone expressing frustration; you practice guessing their feelings and needs.

```
> Help me practice empathic listening
```

**Honest Expression** — Practice expressing yourself using observations, feelings, needs, and requests.

```
> Help me practice honest expression
```

**Anger Practice** — Work through the four steps of expressing anger fully.

```
> Help me practice expressing anger using NVC
```

### What to Expect

1. Claude presents a scenario (or you describe one)
2. You respond using NVC
3. Claude provides brief feedback:
   - What worked well
   - Suggestions for improvement
   - Whether your feeling/need guesses were accurate
4. The scene continues so you can practice again

## Quick Reference

### The 7 Core Needs

When guessing needs, scan these categories:

1. **Connection** — to be seen, understood, belong, loved
2. **Autonomy** — choice, freedom, space, independence
3. **Peace** — ease, calm, rest, relief
4. **Meaning** — purpose, contribution, to matter, competence
5. **Physical well-being** — rest, safety, comfort
6. **Play** — fun, joy, lightness
7. **Honesty** — authenticity, integrity, to be known

### The "So That" Test

If you're unsure whether you've identified a need or a strategy, ask: *"Do they want this so that they can get something else?"*

- If yes → you're at a strategy, go deeper
- If no → you've found the need

### Empathic Listening Template

```
"Are you feeling [feeling] because you're needing [need]?"
```

### Honest Expression Template

```
"When I [observation], I feel [feeling] because I need [need].
Would you be willing to [request]?"
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start with empathic listening** — it's often easier to practice receiving before expressing
2. **Focus on feelings first** — get comfortable identifying true feelings vs. faux feelings
3. **Then layer in needs** — use the 7 core needs as a mental checklist
4. **Practice honest expression** — once receiving feels natural
5. **Combine both** — full NVC dialogues
