## Needs vs. Strategies

| Needs (Universal) | Strategies (Specific) |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Connection | Calling my friend Sarah |
| Rest | Sleeping until noon on Saturday |
| Autonomy | Working from home |
| Nourishment | Eating at that Italian restaurant |
| Fun | Playing video games |
| Safety | Installing a security system |
| Understanding | Reading that book |
| Contribution | Volunteering at the shelter |

**Key insight**: When we confuse strategies with needs, we limit our options. Many different strategies can meet the same need. When conflict arises, it's usually at the strategy level—people often share the same underlying needs.

## The Seven Basic Needs

Marshall Rosenberg identified seven fundamental need categories:

1. **Connection** - Our need for relationships and belonging
2. **Physical Well-being** - Our bodily needs for survival and health
3. **Honesty** - Our need for authenticity and integrity
4. **Play** - Our need for joy and recreation
5. **Peace** - Our need for harmony and ease
6. **Autonomy** - Our need for choice and self-determination
7. **Meaning** - Our need for purpose and contribution

All other needs are variations of these seven.
