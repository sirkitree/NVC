# NVC with Children

Guidance from Marshall Rosenberg's *Raising Children Compassionately* and related NVC parenting resources.

## Core Principles

### Children Deserve Equal Respect

Rosenberg warned about the danger of the word "child" if we allow it to apply a different quality of respect than we would give to someone not labeled a child. Children are complete human beings, not incomplete adults requiring molding.

### Resistance is Universal

"Any time it's our objective to get another person to behave in a certain way, people are likely to resist—whether the other person is 2 or 92 years old."

This objective of getting what we want threatens people's autonomy and their right to choose. This applies to toddlers as much as adults.

### Beyond Punishment and Rewards

Both punishment and reward are forms of "power over" others. NVC is based on "power with" people—mutual trust and respect that makes people open to hearing and learning, giving willingly out of desire to contribute rather than fear of punishment or hope for reward.

## Empathy with Young Children

### Guess, Don't Ask

Instead of asking "How are you feeling?" (which requires verbal ability), NVC practitioners **guess**:

- "Are you feeling sad because you're needing closeness?"
- "I'm sensing you're frustrated because you wanted to do it yourself."
- "Are you scared? Do you need comfort?"

Guessing works with pre-verbal and minimally verbal children because it doesn't require them to articulate. It also models emotional vocabulary.

### Empathy Without Words

Rosenberg noted that "sometimes we can do this silently, just showing in our eyes that we are with their feelings."

With young children, empathic connection happens through:
- Eye contact and presence
- Tone of voice
- Physical closeness and touch
- Simply being with them in their distress

### Presence Before Advice

"All human beings, when they're in pain, need presence and empathy. They may want advice, but they want that after they've received the empathic connection."

With children, this means sitting with their upset before trying to fix, teach, or redirect.

## Protective Use of Force

### When to Use It

Protective force is appropriate when:
- There is imminent threat to safety
- There is no time for dialogue
- The child is unwilling or unable to communicate

Example: Grabbing a child running into the street.

### Protective vs. Punitive Force

| Protective Force | Punitive Force |
|------------------|----------------|
| Intention: prevent injury or injustice | Intention: make someone suffer for wrongdoing |
| No judgment of the child | Labels child as "bad" or "wrong" |
| Assumes child lacks awareness, not character | Assumes child deserves to suffer |
| Connection preserved | Connection damaged |

### How to Apply Protective Force

1. **Act to ensure safety** — physically intervene without blame or anger
2. **Skip the lecture** — in the moment, just ensure safety
3. **Reconnect afterward** — once safe, offer empathy

### After Using Protective Force

Once safety is achieved, return to NVC for repair:

1. **Empathize with the child's experience**: "I'm sensing you were feeling excited and really wanted to chase that ball."

2. **Express your feelings and needs**: "I felt scared because I need you to be safe."

3. **Explore together**: "What else could we do when the ball goes in the street?"

This educational, compassionate follow-up maintains the relationship and teaches without shaming.

## Expressing Yourself to Children

### Use Needs-Based Language

Instead of moral judgments:

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "Stop being bad!" | "I'm feeling worried because I need everyone to be safe." |
| "That's wrong!" | "I'm scared when I see hitting, because I have a need for people in the family to be safe." |
| "You're being selfish." | "I'm frustrated because I'm needing cooperation right now." |

### Make Doable Requests

With young children, requests need to be:
- **Specific**: "Please put the blocks in the bin" (not "Clean up")
- **Positive**: What you want, not what you don't want
- **Doable**: Within their capability
- **Present**: What you want now, not a permanent rule

## When Children Act Out

### Translate Their Behavior into Feelings and Needs

All behavior is an attempt to meet a need. When a child hits, screams, or tantrums, ask yourself:
- What is this child feeling?
- What need are they trying to meet?

Example: A child hitting after being called a name might be feeling angry and needing respect.

### Offer Empathy First

Before correcting behavior, connect with the child's experience:

"I'm sensing that you're feeling angry because you'd like to be treated with more respect. Is that right?"

Once they feel heard, they become more open to hearing your needs and exploring other strategies.

## Rosenberg's Honesty About Parenting

Rosenberg sometimes joked that parenting can involve "spending an hour with your child and then getting two hours of empathy" — acknowledging how challenging it is. Self-empathy for parents is essential.
