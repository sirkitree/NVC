# NVC Interactive Roleplay Practice

Practice Nonviolent Communication through guided roleplay scenarios with Claude.

## How It Works

1. **Choose a scenario** from the list below (or describe your own)
2. **Tell Claude**: "Let's practice NVC with scenario [number]" or describe a situation
3. **Claude plays the other person** — expressing frustration, criticism, or difficult emotions
4. **You respond using NVC** — observations, feelings, needs, requests
5. **Claude provides feedback** — what worked well, suggestions for improvement

## Starting a Practice Session

Say one of these to Claude:

- "Let's practice NVC with scenario 3"
- "I want to practice empathic listening"
- "Help me practice expressing anger using NVC"
- "I had a difficult conversation about [topic] — can we roleplay it?"
- "Give me a random NVC practice scenario"

## Practice Scenarios

### Workplace

1. **Critical boss**: Your manager says "This report is completely unacceptable. I don't know what you were thinking."

2. **Defensive colleague**: A coworker snaps "I already told you I'd get to it. Stop micromanaging me!"

3. **Interrupting teammate**: In a meeting, someone repeatedly talks over you and dismisses your ideas.

4. **Unfair workload**: A colleague says "I can't believe you're leaving at 5 again. Some of us actually care about this project."

5. **Taking credit**: Someone presents your idea as their own in a meeting.

### Family & Relationships

6. **Partner criticism**: Your partner says "You never help around the house. I do everything."

7. **Teenager withdrawal**: Your teen says "Leave me alone! You don't understand anything about my life."

8. **Parental guilt**: A parent says "I sacrificed so much for you and this is how you repay me?"

9. **Sibling conflict**: Your sibling says "You've always been the favorite. Mom and Dad never treated me the same."

15. **Bedtime resistance**: Your child keeps getting out of bed and says "I'm not tired! This is so unfair!"

### Friendship & Social

16. **Cancelled plans**: A friend cancels on you for the third time, saying "Something came up again, sorry."

17. **Unsolicited advice**: A friend says "You really should leave that job/relationship/city. I don't know why you stay."

18. **Gossip pressure**: A friend says "Did you hear what Sarah did? I can't believe it..." expecting you to join in.

19. **Political disagreement**: Someone says "I can't believe anyone would vote for [candidate]. They're destroying the country."

20. **Boundary violation**: A friend shares something you told them in confidence.

### Self-Directed

21. **Inner critic**: Practice self-empathy when your inner voice says "You're such an idiot. You always mess things up."

22. **Guilt spiral**: Practice self-empathy when feeling guilty about not meeting others' expectations.

23. **Procrastination shame**: Practice self-empathy when judging yourself for avoiding important tasks.

## Practice Modes

### Mode 1: Empathic Listening

Focus on receiving the other person with empathy.

**Your goal**: Guess feelings and needs, reflect back, stay curious.

**Example exchange**:
- Partner: "You never help around the house. I do everything."
- You: "Are you feeling exhausted and frustrated because you're needing more support and partnership?"

### Mode 2: Honest Expression

Focus on expressing yourself using OFNR.

**Your goal**: State observations, feelings, needs, and make a request.

**Example exchange**:
- Claude (as you): Sets up a scenario where you need to express something difficult
- You: Practice expressing using "When I see/hear [observation], I feel [feeling] because I need [need]. Would you be willing to [request]?"

### Mode 3: Both Directions

Full NVC dialogue — receive with empathy AND express honestly.

**Your goal**: Toggle between empathic listening and honest expression as the conversation flows.

### Mode 4: Anger Practice

Specifically practice the four steps of expressing anger.

**Your goal**:
1. Stop and breathe
2. Identify your judgments
3. Connect to needs beneath the judgments
4. Express feelings and needs, make a request

## Feedback Claude Will Provide

After each exchange, Claude can offer:

- **What worked well** — NVC elements you used effectively
- **Observation check** — Was it pure observation or mixed with evaluation?
- **Feeling check** — True feeling or faux feeling/thought?
- **Need check** — Universal need or specific strategy?
- **Request check** — Clear, doable, positive request or demand?
- **Alternative phrasings** — Other ways you could have expressed it

## Tips for Practice

1. **It's okay to pause** — In real life, you can say "I need a moment to think about this"

2. **Empathy first** — When someone is upset, usually empathy before expression

3. **Guess, don't interrogate** — "Are you feeling...?" rather than "What are you feeling?"

4. **Stay curious** — If your guess is wrong, that's information — guess again

5. **Imperfect is fine** — NVC is a practice, not a performance

## Custom Scenarios

You can also bring your own situations:

- "I had a fight with my partner about chores. Can we roleplay it?"
- "My boss criticized me today. Here's what they said: [quote]. Help me practice responding."
- "I need to have a difficult conversation with [person] about [topic]. Can we practice?"

Claude will play the other person based on your description, and you can practice your NVC response.
